# Ecommerce-Website

There are a lot of people who purchase items through E-commerce websites. By online shopping, many E-commerce companies were not able to find whether the customers are satisfied with the services provided by the firm. For this reason, we develop a system where various customers give reviews about the product and online shopping services, which in turn help the E-commerce enterprises and manufacturers to get customer opinion to improve service and merchandise through collecting customer reviews. In this system, an algorithm will be used to track and manage customer reviews through collecting topics and opinions from online customer reviews. Our user will be able to view many products and get a link to purchase the product. User can see categorized reviews by searching for certain keywords. The keywords which are already exist in the database will be matched based on the comparison. The system will rate the product and services provided by the enterprise.
